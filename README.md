# NPNLGproject
This is a project aiming at exploring the issue sensitive captioning system by [Nie et al.(2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14451) and an attempt of fitting the [sandbox version of A3DS dataset](https://github.com/polina-tsvilodub/3dshapes-language) by Polina Tsvilodub. We failed to run the [original code](https://github.com/windweller/Pragmatic-ISIC) provided by Nie et al.(2020) or adapt the sandbox version of A3DS dataset to it so the code n this repository is incomplete. But we documented our original idea and attempts in the report.pdf file.

The original A3DS dataset by Burgess & Kim(2018) can be found [here](https://github.com/deepmind/3d-shapes/tree/master)
